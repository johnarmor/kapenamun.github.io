	<h3><p>Cafe Namon offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other in
	<br>
	Bacolod City. We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup of
	<br>
	coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where
	<br>
	you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee. If you need to work,
	<br>
	we have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a
	<br>
	soft-seating area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind 
	<br>
	and body. We offer a delicious variety of coffee by our professionally trained 
	<br>
	baristas. We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty
	<br>
	beverages. All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house with all natural 
	<br>
	ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives) ensuring you the highest quality in
	<br>
	taste & health. You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet
	<br>
	treats made by our very own baker. We look forward to serving you at Cafe Namon!
